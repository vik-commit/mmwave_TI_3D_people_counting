Version 1.2.0
=============

Overview
========

This lab demonstrates the use of TI mmWave sensors to count and track multiple people simultaneously. Using the IWR6843ISK, detection and tracking algorithms run onboard the device to localize people and track their movement with a high degree of accuracy. The algorithms are also set to ignore static objects such as desks or chairs. The lab provides full source code and a CCS project and runs on the TI mmWave sensor IWR6843ISK.
